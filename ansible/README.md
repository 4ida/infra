# notthebee/infra/ansible 

An Ansible playbook that sets up an Ubuntu/Debian-based home media server/NAS with reasonable security, auto-updates and dynamic DNS.

The playbook is mostly being developed for personal use, so stuff is going to be constantly changing and breaking. Use at your own risk and don't expect any help in setting it up on your machine.

## Usage
Install Ansible (macOS):
```
brew install ansible
```

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/notthebee/infra
```

Copy the sample inventory and adjust the variables in `vars.yml`:
```
cd infra/ansible
cp -r group_vars/sample group_vars/YOUR_HOSTNAME
vi group_vars/YOUR_HOSTNAME/vars.yml
```

Create a Keychain item for your Ansible Vault password (on macOS):
```
security add-generic-password \
               -a YOUR_USERNAME \
               -s ansible-vault-password \
               -w
```

The `pass.sh` script will extract the Ansible Vault password from your Keychain automatically each time Ansible requests it.

Encrypt the `secret.yml` file and adjust the variables:
```
ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/YOUR_HOSTNAME/secret.yml
ansible-vault edit group_vars/YOUR_HOSTNAME/secret.yml
```

Add your custom inventory file to `hosts`:
```
cp hosts_example hosts
vi hosts
```

Install the dependencies:
```
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

Finally, run the playbook:
```
ansible-playbook run.yml
```

For consecutive runs, if you only want to update the Docker containers, you can run the playbook like this:
```
ansible-playbook run.yml --tags="port,containers"
```
